# How to Fix WinGet Execution Errors

I recently reinstalled Windows because my computer was running slow. However, when I tried to install packages using the `winget` command, I encountered an issue where it wouldn't even execute.

The command `winget -v` works fine, but the `winget install` command does not execute.

## Solution

You need to update the App Installer.
