# ABOUT

Hello, I'm a developer who loves the web.

## Nickname

- XIYO (pronounced "ee-yo")

I named myself after the rabbit character from "Doki Doki Secret Friends". Since IYO was too common, I initially went with BUNNYxIYO, but it was too long, so only XIYO remained.

## Interests

- Web Accessibility
- Internationalization
- Web Standards

I'm creating a web that transcends physical and language barriers.

## Programming Languages of Interest

- JavaScript
- Svelte
- Java
- HTML (Isn't it a declarative language~?)

## Frameworks and Libraries of Interest

### JS Ecosystem

- Svelte, SvelteKit
- React, Next.js, Remix, React Router
- Astro
- Vite
- Paraglide

The JavaScript ecosystem is overflowing with optimal tools for building products, how can I not love it?

### JAVA Ecosystem

- Spring Boot
- JPA
- Thymeleaf
- JSP

I like it because it's an inevitable K-playground... ðŸ˜Š

### Infrastructure

- Docker
- Raspberry Pi

Isn't it the last gateway to creating products? I can't help but love it.
